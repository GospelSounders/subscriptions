{"subject":"The Bible Instructor","content":"Hi,\n\nReceive greetings from the distant land of gospel sounders. Its been a long long while since you received our weekly \"Sabbath Reformer\". It's our prayer that Jehovah may bless as many as read the issues that we sent, just as He has promised. It is written that He who is faithful in that which is little will be faithful also in much. We thank you for your support in the little and pray that you will support even the much more that is now coming.\n\nGod has blessed our work and enabled us to expand the leaflet into the a monthly magazine - \"the Bible Instructor\". We are happy to send you the introductory issue in soft copy here. You can also contact us for a hard copy for keener reading or for several copies to distribute in your area.\n\nIt's our policy, and a matter of life and death to us, to present in the paper nothing but the \"Present Truth\". Our prayer is that you will make good use of the \"powers to read\" that may have been given you; and in these closing scenes of earth's history, you will surely receive the blessing promised to \"he that readeth\".\n\nYours in the blessed hope,\nBrian Onang'o"}
